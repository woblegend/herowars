Ты можешь присоединиться к группе своих согильдийцев или создать свою. Для входа в приключение необходим один Portal Charge, который ты будешь получать каждый день. Максимум ты можешь накопить до трёх неиспользованных зарядов.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Gain дня</h1>\r\n<p>Gain дня - это модификаторы, влияющие на участников боя с обеих сторон. Например, они могут увеличивать урон, наносимый героями-танками, или ускорять накопление энергии героями поддержки. \r\nThese boosts change every day.\r\nCorrectly select the heroes in the team taking into account the strengthening of the day and you can defeat even very strong opponents! </p>\r\n\r\n<h1> Walkthrough </h1>\r\n<h2> Action Points </h2>\r\n<p>При входе в Adventure участники группы получают определённое количество Очков Действия.\r\nAction points are spent moving between points. One point is required to move between two adjacent points. You can move through several points at once, having spent the corresponding number of Action Points.\r\nAction points cannot be replenished during an adventure, so spend them wisely! </p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Points with opponents </h2>\r\n<p> There are two types: Towers and Squads. A squad is an enemy team that needs to be defeated in order to advance along the adventure map. The towers will strengthen the units in which their rays are directed until they are destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy could not be defeated the first time, he can be attacked again. The health of the heroes of the opposing team will be maintained between attacks, and their energy will not be preserved.\r\nThe Adventuresх более высоких сложностей точки с противниками могут иметь усиления, которые нельзя снять. Учитывай это при планировании маршрута по карте!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Player Strength Points </h2>\r\n<p>На точках, которые выглядят как огромные цветы, ты можешь усилить свою команду. Gain будет действовать на твоих героев до конца приключения. \r\nGain значительно повышают эффективность твоих героев, а каждый участник группы может взять только одно усиление из трёх предложенных на точке, поэтому обсуди с командой, какое усиление ты хочешь взять.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Rewards and Victory Points </h2>\r\n<p> Participating in battles, you earn Victory Points for your team. After collecting a certain amount of points, you can open one of the chests with rewards for points. You can open the boss's chest after defeating the adventure boss. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Teamwork </h2>\r\n<p>Members твоей группы - твои согильдийцы, поэтому относись к ним с уважением и не огорчайся, если у них что-то не получается. Помогайте друг другу и обсуждайте стратегию прохождения в игровом чате или используйте голосовые средства общения.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1> Completion of the adventure </h1>\r\n<p> When all participants in the adventure spend all Action Points or defeat all opponents on the map, the adventure can be completed. Before completing, it will be necessary to open all available chests with rewards.\r\nAdventure также можно завершить досрочно, покинув его через интерфейс Журнала. Покинув группу, ты не сможешь вернуться в неё.\r\nAn unsuccessful adventure will automatically end after %param1% from its beginning. </p>\r\n<h1>Twisting Chaos</h1>\r\n<p>Twisting Chaos - это последнее и самое сложное приключение. В нём тебя ждёт новая карта и новый босс каждый день. </p>\r\n</html>",
